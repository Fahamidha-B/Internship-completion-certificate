# Internship-completion-certificate

I worked as a data scientist intern at BEPEC Solutions (OPC) Pvt. Ltd in Bangalore. Throughout my journey, I learned a variety of technologies, including Anaconda for Python programming and web applications uisng sypder. PowerBI for data visualization. Writing queries in MySQL and postgresql for database administration. Data cleansing, extraction, feature engineering, and statistical data analysis. various performance done to measure central tendency, correlation coefficient, Anova test, t-test, various distributions to measure mean, median, and mode, etc. I also studied machine learning algorithms for training the model to attain the best accuracy, precession, recall, and f1-score. Also performed standardization measures to ensure that the machine learning algorithm works. I learned deep learning on my own, focusing on ANN and CNN models and having some basic understanding of the RNN model.  i am having basic knowledge of tableaue for data visualization.
